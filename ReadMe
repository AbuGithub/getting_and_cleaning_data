This document provides a road map for the project. It shows the process by which the raw data are extracted and processed via an
R script "run_analysis.R" documenting the list of variables in the processed data provided as a codebook and finally the outcome of
running the script is a tidy data set, called "tidydata.txt"

The Process:

 1) First, set the working directory & download the datasets from the URL given in the project assignment page
 2) Unzip the downloaded files under the working directory. The entire dataset and associated files sits in a directory under the working directory.
 3) First read the datasets from the "train" subfolder and then read from the "test" subfolder
 4) Combine both datasets into a single data frame
 5) Extract only variables that represent mean and standard deviation measurements
 6) Read the activity label and assign the descriptive activity labels to the combined dataset; replace existing column labels
 with tidy labels by replacing "-,() " etc. and assign back the new labels
 7) Reshape the combined dataset based on subject and activity and summarize the mean of all variables
 8) Change the hyphenated column labels with simpler texts that becomes the labels for tidy dataset
 9) write out the tidy dataset as "tidyset.txt"
 
 CodeBook: Please see the file "CodeBook.MD"
 Final Data: "tidydata.txt"
